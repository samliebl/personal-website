                        amid the parties and quick sounds<br>
                        nor twilights underneath moonlit tryst boughs<br>
                        that made a ceiling for us.<br>
                        there are other ways to make you know<br>
                        how deep it is that my love goes.

                        So can we step out now?<br>
                        And though it&rsquo;s dark and wet;<br>
                        the world is like a rainy window<br>
                        made slick and phosphorescent.<br>
                        I lived once on a bridge of cabs<br>
                        from here to Denver.<br>
                        Across town to your apartment<br>
                        so like all the others, only<br>
                        I am not in them tonight.<br>
                        And none of those<br>
                        will ever know<br>
                        how deep it is<br>
                        that my love goes.

                        as I pushed it;<br>
                        and I must have known you even then,<br>

                        I must have heard some echo<br>
                        and felt you in my breast<br>
                        which until then was a hollow place<br>
                        because I had not met you yet.
