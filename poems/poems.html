                        We don&rsquo;t need nights in Montreal<br>
                        amid the parties and quick sounds<br>
                        nor twilights spent beneath<br>
                        moonlit tryst boughs<br>
                        that made a ceiling for us.<br>
                        There are other ways to make you know<br>
                        how deep it is that my love goes.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        So can we step out now?<br>
                        Though it is dark and wet;<br>
                        the world like a rainy window<br>
                        all slick and phosphorescent.<br>
                        I lived once on a bridge of cabs<br>
                        from here to Denver.<br>
                        Across town to your apartment<br>
                        so like all the others, only<br>
                        I am not in them tonight.<br>
                        And none of those<br>
                        will ever know<br>
                        how deep it is<br>
                        that my love goes.

                        the cold cluster of the banished air outside<br>
                        knocking in its silent, ancient cry.

                        in one of those points of earth<br>
                        where the corners of the panorama<br>
                        come together in a cathedral<br>

                        does justice<br>
                        and the horizon<br>
                        is nearer now<br>
                        and it&#8217;s as if<br>
                        all the ships are anchoring<br>
                        to wave flags in colors<br>
                        corresponding to the sunset palette<br>
                        the sun seems not to set, but stills<br>
                        reluctant to infringe the sea<br>
                        at least, that&#8217;s how it seems to me.

                        with some other name in the poems.<br>

                        then while you laughed,<br>
                        through the music of your laughter:<br>
                        I mean I&rsquo;d post it on my site<br>
                        something like that only by happenstance<br>
                        might these resemble someone alive.

                        She has a baby; she must be married<br>

                        I just saw you had some poems<br>
                        and I always knew you wrote them.<br>
                        Something made me want to call you.<br>
                        I married Dylan. Do you remember him?<br>
                        I&rsquo;d be quiet then.<br>
                        You are still the only person I have met<br>
                        who can smirk and I don&rsquo;t like you less.<br>
                        In fact, I never want this call to end<br>
                        this poem is making me fall<br>
                        in love with you all over again.
