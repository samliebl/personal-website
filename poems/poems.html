                        It wouldn’t do<br>
                        to take my eyes off of you,<br>
                        to pretend for one second that<br>
                        you weren’t always on my mind.<br>
                        I think about you all the time.

                        your lips, strayed from our kiss,<br>
                        left me unbereft of emptiness.<br>
                        You are hardly forgotten,<br>
                        nor will you be unmissed.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        It would be a lie,<br>
                        an affront to try,<br>
                        a ruse, miscarried, and so belie<br>
                        that in your absence I am not fine,<br>
                        that I am not happy but resigned.

                        strength in the shade of your neglect.<br>
                        Your going has weight to it and heft.<br>
                        it is tissue and breathing flesh.

                        It has dimension, place and depth.<br>
                        Your lack is all remaining of you,<br>
                        a presence only in my head.

                    <h4>Her Laughter—<em>for A. B.</em></h4>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        When she laughs and I hear her<br>
                        walking in front of her or behind<br>
                        no matter our distance, I am near her;<br>
                        she replaces every thought in my mind<br>
                        The water of it, jumping, pouring,<br>
                        amid her lips, flowing, soaring<br>
                        from her neck, her head thrown back,<br>
                        igniting all the air she breathes,<br>
                        in thrilling fingerprints she leaves<br>
                        on me with what her laughter says.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        And what her laughter says is that:<br>
                        “I am nowhere else but with you now.”<br>
                        Then, this having been announced,<br>
                        the space around her levitates;<br>
                        it becomes a little weightless,<br>
                        elevating those who surround her,<br>
                        and endows on the air the traces<br>
                        of lightning that the water chases,<br>
                        the flash of flame which dances<br>
                        in splashes on the water’s faces<br>
                        down the dips and rippling places<br>
                        makes electric that air with luster<br>
                        her voice is joy and life recovered.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her voice is notes of sunlit motes<br>
                        like fireflies that float in close<br>
                        in late summer and never rest<br>
                        the parts of them that softly glow.<br>
                        When she talks, it’s like her laughter<br>
                        is gathered up in bales together,<br>
                        in melodies, and gently tethered.<br>
                        Her words redound the gales of air<br>
                        then from the music of her laughter<br>
                        all at once, lyrics are there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        So, her laughter has an overture<br>
                        its denouement, its quiet end,<br>
                        when her slowly fading singing,<br>
                        holding, however losing ringing,<br>
                        and, yet even as silence tries,<br>
                        to eclipse her choir inside from sight,<br>
                        their memory friable in the bright,<br>
                        her laughter is more gorgeous still<br>
                        than any words I could ever write.
