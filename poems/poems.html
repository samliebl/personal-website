                        amid the parties and quick sounds<br>
                        nor twilights underneath<br>
                        moonlit tryst boughs<br>
                        that made a ceiling for us.<br>
                        there are other ways to make you know<br>
                        how deep it is that my love goes.

                        So can we step out now?<br>

                        the world like a rainy window<br>
                        dripping and phosphorescent.<br>
                        I lived once on a bridge of cabs<br>
                        from here to Denver.<br>
                        Across town to your apartment<br>
                        so like all the others, only<br>
                        I am not in them tonight.<br>
                        And none of those<br>
                        will ever know<br>
                        how deep it is<br>
                        that my love goes.

                        So I made you.<br>
                        I carved you of gleaming marble; it was<br>
                        as white as the drunken clouds<br>
                        parading the sky when I looked up.<br>
                        They were painful memories only, to me now.<br>
                        They swept above the plow<br>
                        as I pushed it;<br>
                        and I must have known you even then,<br>
                        as unknowable your beauty is,<br>
                        I must have heard some echo<br>
                        and felt you in my breast<br>
                        which until then was a hollow place<br>
                        because I had not met you yet.

                        against the azure sea sunken in the sky!<br>
                        I took that blue and made your eyes.<br>
                        I blanched the ivory for your bones<br>
                        and once pristine, I smoothed them so<br>
                        I could make you stand, and sit, and roam;<br>
                        yet be as silent as a mountain reach;<br>
                        and as silky as fresh ocean foam.

                        I wove the bowstrings of your throat<br>
                        so they&rsquo;d sing the sighs of trees<br>
                        and hit the lonely, plaintive notes<br>
                        for with you I want to weep<br>
                        and be contained by you.<br>
                        So I made you.

                    <h4>Mannequins</h4>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        For a second I thought the mannequins were real.<br>
                        They hung suspended, twisted heels.<br>
                        An abrupt tableau of space existing<br>
                        to advertise the ways of wearing<br>
                        specific dresses which one could buy<br>
                        in the store situated behind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        They had no faces, but were impossibly thin,<br>
                        dresscloth writing deliquescent lines<br>
                        over pale angelic bones, and back again,<br>
                        to hover over the floor, like hearts stopped<br>
                        after missing beats, they took you quickly<br>
                        and beckoned with obliviousness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        They were built for their poses,<br>
                        constructed for no other motive<br>
                        than to dance for us, jauntily anchored<br>
                        in their defiant frieze.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        And their eyes would be cold<br>
                        if they had any.<br>
                        Luckily, they were blank plastic.<br>
                        And they look both bored and interested<br>
                        and I can&rsquo;t help thinking<br>
                        that they represent a better class of human:<br>
                        tall and unaffected,<br>
                        both the men and the women.

                    <h4>Most of These</h4>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Most of these were written on trains<br>
                        sliding quietly along tracks,<br>
                        snowflakes caressing windowpanes<br>
                        until violet nightfall dimmed to black.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Alleyways laid with metal bent,<br>
                        the winter bloom of snow unfurled<br>
                        as people stepped on and then went<br>
                        like all the good things in this world
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Most of these were written, subject<br>
                        caught clearly by image in mind<br>
                        and if not, I would resurrect<br>
                        her from details she&#8217;d left behind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her missing pieces were woven<br>
                        cloth contrived to correspond<br>
                        to dialog among actors chosen<br>
                        and known beforehand all along.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Most of these were written not to<br>
                        just one woman but to many,<br>
                        though emotions, a certain few<br>
                        unify them all within me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Or, they were written in sorrow,<br>
                        that shadow cast by the twilight,<br>
                        silently painting the barrows<br>
                        in indigo and anthracite
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        from a depth just beneath my bed,<br>
                        stared out of in the morning,<br>
                        not alive, yet not quite dead,<br>
                        not falling apart, not forming,
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        not anguished, but falling tangled<br>
                        in between aphotic and alight,<br>
                        scarred, haggard, pock-marked and mangled,<br>
                        too sedate, too weakened to revive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Most of these I wrote on streetcars,<br>
                        when, in the last hours of the day,<br>
                        you can start to see the first stars<br>
                        like diamonds sunk in vivid gray.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Written and again rewritten<br>
                        making headway over the chops<br>
                        as the tram car jumped now and then<br>
                        swaying on the rails between stops.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        All of these remain unfinished,<br>
                        because, captured in ink I find,<br>
                        on paper dull and diminished<br>
                        what brightly burned behind my eyes
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        When the doors opened, every time<br>
                        little caprioles of snow twirled,<br>
                        shapes appearing to augur signs,<br>
                        perhaps of good things in my world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        The train moves faster where there lay<br>
                        straight sections where the track uncurls.<br>
                        Houses slipped by, then slipped away<br>
                        like all the good things in this world.
