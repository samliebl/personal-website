                                    […]&ensp;You asked me can you join me<br>
                                    on a walk at home, could I please?<br>
                                    you had word you would share<br>
                                    By the glade of cherry trees, I said<br>
                                    I will meet you there.

                                    Wondering in fear, as I too often do,<br>
                                    what news you&#8217;d say that afternoon<br>
                                    What happening so hurt your conscience,<br>
                                    come up among us since<br>
                                    a spring and summer of innocence<br>
                                    the inflorescent hours we spent<br>
                                    that came and went<br>
                                    in the copse of blooming cherry trees,<br>
                                    the one with the baby saplings<br>
                                    growing in their nurseries.<br>
                                    In the orchard where<br>
                                    you and I would meet,<br>
                                    the shadows upon your face<br>
                                    were no longer those<br>
                                    cast by the cherry trees.<br>
                                    The curves of your cheek
                                    held a new dark, which, though infant,<br>
                                    I knew would never leave.<br>
                                </p>

                                    Then you told me what<br>
                                    you had to say<br>
                                    the love you felt<br>
                                    had flown away.<br>
                                    As quickly as it came,<br>
                                    after our vernal waste,<br>
                                    then a joyous summer space<br>
                                    which, as I ruminate<br>
                                    had memories so fragile that<br>
                                    a touch and they’d disintegrate.<br>
                                    That floated until summer was late<br>
                                    sometime in the canicular days.

                            REVOLT! — The southeastern barons have yet again risen up against their lord, the DUKE of TERA. To put down the insurrection, he personally marches an EXPEDITIONARY FORCE deep into the lands of the defiant vassals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To guard the homefront in his absence, the DUKE has recalled his son EATHEL from foreign campaigns and appointed him MARSHALL, empowered to lead the garrisons remaining in defense of the main part of the realm. His father far away, indefinitely absorbed in quelling the REBELLION, the new marshall spreads his trusted BAND of VETERANS and green RECRUITS in defense of the vast HOME FRONT.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He has barely made his preparations when word of MAYHEM in a border region makes its way to him…
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lug"></div>
                    <p class="stanza prose"><span class="chapter-open">The rumor was</span> of danger racing through the south. Serixiphina, the woman who lived in his head, was especially attuned to rumor; she had a great instinct for the general mood of any situation. For Eathel’s part, he had excellent hearing. Or perhaps it was Sera, through him, extending and deepening his hearing to some pitch beyond what could be captured by others’ ears. He would ask her. She’d claim the interpretation most favoring her; she would, in exquisite nonchalance, assert that credit was hers for any ability he might have; but she always claimed that, especially when it wasn’t true.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">So, with his hearing or with Sera’s, or theirs together, more than once, at the fort where he was taking inventory and performing an inspection of the garrison’s progress there, he heard some mixture of the following: armed men were coming from outside by way of the south. Word differed. Sometimes those around him said the band was coming from the west or farther east, but mostly the talk was on the southwest.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">An alien incursion was not an outlandish notion. But it required a great deal of speculation based on the information now available. He would wait until he heard something real. Perhaps it would remain only a rumor.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Still, Sera told him to watch that rumor. I cannot say for sure, she had said, but I think there is something to this.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Talk of the purported invasion started so quickly none of the men around him had even mentioned it to him in passing. But it soon became pervasive enough that Eathel had already resolved to take it to an officer to get a verified report.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">He had only just made that resolution, there, in the mud of the works of the fort he was at to inspect that garrison’s progress, and then Sera was there, as if she always had been there for hours.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Someone is coming, she said. He looked over at her. All he could see of her was the light of her smile, which looked like some trick of the sun, flickering just next to him, about as high up close to his face as a woman’s would be if a woman actually stood there now. It was her broad smile that always meant one more thing than he could figure. She smiled that way most often, her smile of two smiles.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">A small commotion had developed by the main palisade. Someone called him to come over. In the misty wind and cold and muck, he walked toward an exchange of information that would set off the second great adventure of his life.</p>
                    <div class="sb"></div>
                    <p class="stanza prose">A herald had arrived. Not even taking the time to dismount, he waited to be invited to speak, panting quietly with alert eyes. They had dark circles them, despite their agitation. Under stains from mud and weather he had on the livery of a prominent lord south of the mountains. Eathel recognized the worn orange lion vaguely but had forgotten whatever family it armigerated. He knew it was one of his father’s vassals, but he had not had much to do with that particular corner of the southeast, far past the mountain range. And his father had many lords under him.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">After asking whether he wanted water, Eathel bid him speak.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“Lord marshal, on behalf of my liege, it pains me to inform you that our realm was three days past attacked.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Well, it wasn’t a rumor anymore. Told you, Sera said.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Every now and then Eathel and Sera were so in accord they would say the same thing at the same moment. “Where are you from and who is your lord?” they asked. He heard her languid</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“Is your master still in control of his lands?”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“He is,” said the herald. "So far, the posse’s conduct has been that of a band of marauders, not an army vying to spar with us on the field.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Rules out a state, said Sera. Perhaps, he replied.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“Go on,” said Eathel.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“It was in the morning of that day, three days past, when we first heard a report by some travelers of a large band of warriors amount, making their way through our lands unchecked. According to a second report, this band apparently merely rode at first, but then they set fire to a village—the few travelers who had brought the news into the capital that morning disagreed on where, but they were agreed on the notion these men came from the southern border.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“How many are these men?” asked Eathel</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“Three score. Of those armed, at least.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“What else have they done?”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“They burned a place where locals congregate near a town. The people gather there for trading crops; it is a little market, and many were there that day; they killed at least ten there first, then set upon another town ten miles north of there. And that crop exchange lost three siloes of many thousand pounds of grain.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Eathel waited. He outranked the herald, and so the emissary must show him deference and interview at the pace set by his Duke’s agent and marshall of his lands. But it was clear he felt he’d answered enough and now needed a response. Eathel still waited and looked at ragged soldier. Apparently, the herald would need to answer more.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“At the town,” the herald continued, “they killed anyone they saw. So far we know they lost three tens dead, struck down with no cause. Of material damage, several houses and part of a wall; and they robbed a church, seizing gold in coin and silver pieces of liturgy, and This was all I knew when I was sent here.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“Who were they?”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“I do not know,” said the herald. “As it concerns the witnesses who relayed the news, they did not notice anything particular about them, and they had no emblem discernible. They bore no distinguishing marks, nor did they appear foreign.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“Where are they now?”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“When I left, they made for a manor nearby. The owner there is my lord’s neighbor; their properties share a border. So my master was compelled to fortify his own estate,” the herald said. “When I departed the brigands were moving east at speed. It is my current understanding they are moving north also.”</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Ask him where they came from, said Sera. “Where did they come from?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“They emerged from our southern side. I know nothing else,” the herald replied.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Eathel again went quiet. The man just looked at him. The envoy had shared what he had to report. He had answered more questions than he had expected. Now it was up to the person charged with protecting the realm, stewarding it in trust while his father was occupied, to act.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">He remembered someone telling him during his last campaign abroad, amid a stream of battles and camps and the smell of dead bodies, that, when it came down to it, the only form of tactical preparation that made any sense was to prepare, not with stratagems, but to be caught off your guard.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">Sera rolled her eyes, eyes which could neither see nor be seen. The thought seemed poetic as he entertained it. Ah yes, she sighed. The only thing to plan for is that you will be taken by surprise. What a priceless jewel of counsel.</p>
