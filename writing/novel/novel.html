                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">“the bastard boy duke,” said the man who would, within the hour, kill Eathel. Eathel was indeed a bastard, but the ‘duke’ part of the insult was his father, the Duke of Tera; it would never be Eathel; especially now that his father’s second wife had just a few years past given birth to a son, the real son, the heir apparent to the mightiest region in this corner of the known world.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Men tacked on ‘duke’ precisely to ridicule him the title he might have had, but never would.</p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">“It stung all the more because it was a title the people of Tera had, not so long ago, expected would likely pass to Eathel himself; despite having been born of sin and moral lapse to a commoner, was the strongest male blood relative to the Duke his father.</p>
                <p class="stanza prose">“Early in life his father had Eathel sworn in as the sole heir to the Duchy of Tera, provided there were no legitimate children in the future. All the vassals had knelt before him, child though he was, and swore to be Eathel’s man for life. For a while, they acted as if they meant it. That was, at least until his father remarried.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni">Clang. Swing. Dodge. Clang back. Both shuffle away.</p>
                        <p class="prose">They circled one another en guard. The swords that had been making the racketous grima in the little holy clearing, deep in the woods, held up before them, their ends occasionally touching in a few nervous taps.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“My god. You look so much like your father,” said the man.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">So this attacking stranger not only recognized him, Eathel realized, but apparently knew his father’s appearance well enough to see the strong resemblance between the powerful Duke of Tera and his off-born boy that everyone invariably remarked on.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">A rapid clanging of sword on sword. The woods about them muffled the sharp report of whooshing, swinging metal, instantly arrested to an abrupt stop by an equally deadly swing of a scythe, to a sound like the breaths the two men panted out.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Sword fighting was the sound of sharp screams on metal or whispers from the singing swings of the blade, nothing in between. They had enough space to be loud here, encircled as they were with the rune-carved rocks of the old sacred site that stood silent sentinels to their duel, holding back the forest a bit, or the passel of retainers each offended party brings to a duel of honor between gentlemen. Neither of these two are gentlemen, Sera said. You’re right, he said. As usual, she smirked.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">His attention went back to the man who had conceded that it was Eathel, not he, who would perish in the duel.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“You are so certain of defeat,” said Eathel. “I have not beaten you yet.”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Their blades clanged again, binding for a moment as both men panted in brief respite.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“Oh, but you will,” said Eathel’s foil.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The man feinted a lunge. Eathel setzte him ab. The man shuffled back into a resting guard, his sword up and at attention in front of him.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“I have heard tales of your exploits abroad,” Eathel’s opponent said.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Clang. Shuffle. Clang.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“And of your facility,”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Clang. Tapping, testing his left again.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“With the blade,” said the man, lunging, but overreaching, stumbling a bit.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Eathel parried, though, it was really more of a tap on the blade and a dodge out of the way of the man’s stumble.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Let him talk, said Serixiphina, the woman who lived in his head. You're on an investigation; this is your chief lead. He clearly wants to talk.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">He nodded at her, though Sera had no face or head to nod at. There was nothing really at all to see to her, save, may be a wisp of shadow at broad daylight and the slim white, glowing sliver of a mouth, where a woman’s mouth would be if a real one stood by him. And these were faint even to Eathel; no one else had ever seemed to notice her phantom grin.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p class="stanza prose">“They say you are guided by angels,” the man said, smiling. They were both stepping around one another in a circle.</p>
                                <p class="stanza prose">“Well, then that makes it sound like I have a lot of help,” said Eathel. “it does not much recommend my skill if heaven itself must intercede.”</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="stanza prose">Can you hear anything in his accent, Eathel asked Sera. I was listening for the same thing. Could be anywhere in Tera or beyond.</p>
                                <p class="stanza prose">He talks like someone who hasn’t stayed in one place very long.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The man laughed. “where I am from, our god is angry. It is a warrior god. When its acolytes displease it, it makes war on them.”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“Sounds like an unfair fight,” said Eathel. “And where is this place?”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“A place where we take seriously our god’s calls for violence,” said the man. They were still shuffling in little steps around the same invisible point at their center, moving closer until their blades were in danger of tapping.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“I’ve been to a place like that. Though I found before long that the calls we heard for violence came not from any god,” said Eathel.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The man lunged to Eathel’s left in a waist-high sweep; Eathel parried a bit too fancily, holding his sword a bit too far up his shoulders.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“I sincerely doubt you have ever been where I am from,” said the man, spitting after his failed sally.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“Who are you? Where are you from?” asked Eathel. “Why did you do what you did?”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“I can’t answer three questions at once. But what,” said the man; while he spoke, his eyes flicked to take in the terrain. Eathel took this opportunity to dive in with a lunge calculated to catch him by surprise. The man was a bit rattled in his response, but he recovered and, on instinct, batted away Eathel’s thrusting stab with surprising strength given the angle of the man’s sword. His attacher’s hands fought a bit separate from him; Eathel quickly got the feeling this body he faced had the memories of innumerable battles engrained in its sinew.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Such was his composure that he finished the sentence after a few panting pauses to address Eathel’s foray. “is it exactly I did?” asked the man.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“Ravaged an innocent people. Murdered children. Burned their houses and their food,” said Eathel.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“Oh yes, there’s that,” said the man. He lunged then, instantly forward. Eathel parried. “If my god judges their deaths in accord with divine law, my god will grant me serenity and thrill in endless cycle, forever and always, well past the end of time.”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“But if your religion’s followers are anything like you, divining divine law in every case of violence, your god sounds interminably battling paperwork instead.”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Blades tapped. Both shuffled; neither made any move of consequence.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">“Is that perhaps not why your god never becomes personally involved in earthly strife?” asked Eathel.</p>
                        <!-- prev. -->
                        <p class="stanza prose">The man laughed. “And it would be, for our god is strong,” said the man. “But it does not itself strap on its war regalia”</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="">
                                <p class="stanza prose">He’s edging closer, said Sera. I see it, said Eathel. This yarn is intended to distract you from some kind of attack, she said. I know, he said. Well, I have a vested interest in your heart continuing to beat; you ought not be surprised I take an interest in your physical wellbeing.</p>
                                <p class="stanza prose">The left muscles tense, said Sera. It’s now.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="stanza prose">A smooth, elegant, deadly move and the man was suddenly on Eathel’s outside right with his attacker’s sword somehow transposed to the man’s outside hand. If Eathel hadn’t been looking for the move and ready for it, the man would have had nothing in his path to Eathel’s armpit and up.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">But instead, Eathel swung back and out to the right, staying aside the man’s thrust. His sword was too long to get a good thrust of his own into the man, but he could punch the crossbar of his sword into the man’s face. This, Eathel did, with the degree of strength and ferocity he only ever seemed to be able to harness when he was about to die.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The blow landed with a thick, wet slap right where Eathel wanted it to. right in his attacker’s cheekbone</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Eathel felt elation and power. His hate, borne of fear, for this man flash froze into a cool and insidious hate for this man, this one borne of anger. Kill him? How dare he try to take his life from him.</p>
                        <div class="level">
                            <div>
                                <p class="stanza prose">The man yelped and screamed loudly enough Eathel may have knocked out a few teeth through his cheek; he stumbling back, momentarily drunk on a strong whiskey of pain. But he quickly got control of himself. Still, Eathel could tell the wound was hurting and starting to take up more attention.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="stanza prose">What was he saying about angels? asked Sera in her languid voice. And being guided by them?
                                </p>
                                <p class="stanza prose">Perhaps there’s something to religion after all, said Eathel. And if you’re my valkyrie, that’s even more fuel upon the the fire, because what god would send me Serixiphina but a wrathful one, like his?</p>
                                <p class="stanza prose">Pay attention, she whispered close in his ear.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The main hefted his sword and charged in a lunge at Eathel, who parried well enough that, combined with the disorganized fury of the man’s attack, saw them punching at one another in close proximity; there was no metal sounding off the trees. Just desperate grunts and heaving groans.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Then the attacker slammed his forehead into Eathel’s nose with a soft crunch and a lightning bolt of pain that was all their was in the world for a moment. Blood in his eyes. His face was a mask of pain. Eathel spat blood and spit on the man and tore him to the ground.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">They went down in an embrace, tumbling down the side of a ridge. They rolled over one another. Eathel’s back of the neck slammed into a tree trunk; he went dizzy for a moment; the man's leg slammed into a rock and there was a snap, maybe of the leg, maybe of a branch, while they tumbled into one another into a ravine at the base of the hill, twisted among each other. The man had a bone breaking through the pale skin of his calf, but had already started shuffling his body, moving toward something, squirming his body against Eathel’s.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The dagger Sera had reminded him to bring was half sticking out of its sheath on Eathel’s belt and the man pulled it out and stabbed Eathel in the leg.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">The dagger was stuck in his leg—in his thigh, a deep cut. They tossed on the ground some more until Eathel grabbed the knife out of the side of his leg and stabbed it desperately in the man's neck and the left side of the man’s neck opened into an obscene little waterfall of blood.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Just before he sawed his way through the man’s vocal cords, the dying man was able to sputter out, “see? I am vanquished. I said be,” Glug. “fore. You would,” cough, “kill,” cough, “me.”</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Eathel stopped to hear if he would say more, but the dead man had lost the ability to speak.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Eathel caught his breath, staggering; he inhaled deeply and put his fingers to his mouth and tried to whistle. Instead, he spat some blood and coughed. He now felt some deep aches in his stomach. After a few tries, he finally was able to whistle loudly enough that the high, shrill sound cut out through the air and bounced off the mountains of the little valley. He hoped Echobella could hear it.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Blood was freely flowing from his leg.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Eathel rolled the man over and looked more closely at him. He had on a thick jacket, but it had an inner lining that was soft and thin enough to make a passable bandage.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">While he shredded out strips of cloth, he looked the man over. He found nothing that gave him any idea who the men were. The man was a average size, didn't look like he was from any place in particular.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">As he cut the jacket around his upper arm, Eathel did see a tattoo on his shoulder, but on the side facing forward, so it was only visible head on. Where some legions in the levies put their marks. And indeed there was the number eight where the number of the battalion would go.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">But the insignia was a splotchy kind of ‘v’ shape. It did not so much look like symbol or depiction of an animal or weapon or tree or something, which these types of things usually were; rather, it looked more a mistake by them who tapped in the ink.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Was it a country?</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">That doesn’t look like anyone’s lands I know of, said Sera.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Me neither, said he.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">After he had cut through the front of the man’s coat, tattered to pieces to the point his leg was going numb and the bleeding seemed squelched from the bandage-tourniquet he’d ended up making; he took a few breaths and looked longingly up the hill he’d just tumbled down. He desperately wanted to go back up for the man’s sword in its sheath, but he couldn’t chance the time and effort looking for it. There was his wound and the task ahead of him. Still, what a shame to leave behind so valuable an instrument.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">He could probably get his mail though.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">He tried standing and fell when he put weight on the injured leg and felt a profound shout of pain. He lay on the ground, wincing, blinking out a few threads of tears as the pain throbbed back and forth like the bell banging part of a bell, back and forth. After a few moments of receding pain, he crawled over to rest against a tree. Letting out a few groans of pain.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Let’s see if that sobbing makes it into the ballad, said Sera.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">What happened to being worried about me? he asked.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">You were right. I was overreacting, she said.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">I can’t believe it.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">I can overreact. I rarely do. But it’s possible.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">No, I meant how I’m ‘right.’</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">What?</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">You said ‘you were right.’</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Oh, she said, rolling her eyes. I didn’t even notice I was saying it because acknowledging your rectitude is no great labor for me; I seldom do it because it seldom turns out to be the case.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">You have no problem saying ‘I’m right’?</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Not at all, dear heart, she said.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">No, I mean that I, Eathel, vis-a-vis myself, am right. Not that you have any reservations claiming yourself correct.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Is this really what you want to be talking about right now? Do you not need to be getting out of here?</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">It’s in Bella’s hands now, or her hooves, as it were. I’m not going to try to stand any more on this leg if I can help it. Bella will be an hour or two away in negotiating a way down that ravine. What the hell else are we supposed to do?</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Talk about what happened, said Sera.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">What happened, he said, flatly.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">He was in a strange mood, somehow less inclined to a strategic exercise in thinking.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Perhaps it was his having just before slammed a ceremonial knife into a stranger’s neck and watched the man die, moaning on top of him, an inch from his face, in the climax to an intimate, ghastly tantrum of violence during which he’d nearly died himself.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Or, on the other hand, it might very well be that it was the hour following all that he had spent cutting bandages off of his assailant’s dead body.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Yes. What we know. What we think. We have not yet made an inventory of what transpired these three days past.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Very well. Proceed, he said.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Yes, thank you, she said icily. So, when that herald arrived</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Proceed, he said and paused. Knowing I’m right.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">I can’t believe you. We were not even talking about anything. I was talking about you crying like a baby. But yes. So right.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">Excellent. Now, proceed, he said.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">She started again, daring him to start anew a-japing among them. Valuing his sanity, he demurred.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose">they had been inspecting the works at the south-central garrison. What happened started there three days ago. At first it was nothing but murmurs around the fort.</p>
