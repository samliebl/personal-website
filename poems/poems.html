                    <h3>Young</h3>
                    <p>This is a group of poems called “Young.” They’re called that because I wrote almost all of them from 2010-2011, when I was 20 and 21. Some I added in the rest of my early twenties up to 25 or so.</p>
                    <p>Some well known artists (in this case writers) have collections of “juvenilia,” which are compendia of works written by authors in their youth. Usually only writers with the acclaim of an Austen or a Yeats have their early work collected and published. But I didn’t let that stop me from making one. I consider this my own juvenilia.</p>
                    <p>My voice has changed. I have changed. I have done some editing, but these are more or less the poems they were over a decade ago as of this writing. These aren’t the poems I would write today. They aren’t written the way I would write them today. For a long time, I didn&rsquo;t even think I would ever make them public. Whether they’re good or bad isn’t entirely up to me, but there are some I’m proud of and others…well, let’s say I cringed reading more than a few of these.</p>
                    <p>That brings up the question of why I would want to share stuff I am embarrassed by. Well, a) there is always going to be some writing I have that is so ridiculous it’s either going to remain locked in its notebook or Word document; b) I have a tendency to procrastinate and find excuses not to do things, and I could see a lot of dithering getting in my way if I stopped and asked myself whether a poem was good enough to put on the internet; and, c) to me, the spirit of juvenilia is that they include, to put it charitably in my case, ‘early attempts’ at writing that isn’t all that good but is of interest due to the subject of the collection.</p>
                    <p>So, “Young” has a first part, which are poems with titles, but there are also these pseudo appendices, “Untitled Poems” and “Fragments.” The former should be pretty self explanatory. The latter is just gathered bits and pieces of writing, usually only a few lines long.</p>
                    <p>All together, these poems, along with—especially with—the Untitleds and Fragments, are my own juvenilia.</p>

                    <h3>Untitled Poems</h3>
                    <p>These are poems I picked out of notes, journals, computers, phones, scraps of paper in boxes and everywhere in between. In terms of completeness, they&rsquo;re a mixed bag.</p>
                    <p>Some are pretty much done and I just haven&rsquo;t given them a title. Some are half-done. Some are just a few lines. Some are prose poems. Most of the prose ones are mixed toward the end.</p>
                    <p>So far, many posted here were written around the same time I wrote the &ldquo;Young&rdquo; group. I might work on some or use them in a different way. Mainly I&rsquo;m just in a phase of posting everything. I tend toward perfectionism, which usually means I never post anything at all. I&rsquo;m working on changing that.</p>

                        We don&rsquo;t need nights in Montreal<br>
                        amid the parties and quick sounds<br>
                        nor twilights spent beneath<br>
                        moonlit tryst boughs<br>
                        that made a ceiling for us.<br>
                        There are other ways to make you know<br>
                        how deep it is that my love goes.

                        So can we step out now?<br>

                        the world like a rainy window<br>
                        all slick and phosphorescent.<br>
                        I lived once on a bridge of cabs<br>
                        from here to Denver.<br>
                        Across town to your apartment<br>
                        so like all the others, only<br>
                        I am not in them tonight.<br>
                        And none of those<br>
                        will ever know<br>
                        how deep it is<br>
                        that my love goes.

                    <h4>Alive in Asheville</h4>
                    <h5>I. 2008-2009</h5>
                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        I look at the sky more in Asheville.

                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        When God said, “<span class="sc">Let there be light</span>,” that first light must have been the color of those mountains, seen in dark lavender, from very far away. The sky looked like it had folded into the earth; the crease was that distant raise of the earth. The Blue Ridge Mountains.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        I look at the sky more in Asheville. It is high in the mountains, and on certain days, nature sees it fit to warp the typical colors of life and distend the tranquility of the day, so they put on a show of spilled paint, shot through with flame. In Asheville, the sun is a kamikaze. It is reckless and has a death wish. Every day it would plunge into the pale wrinkle of the mountains and burn the sky until it was amaranthine. The sun was profoundly unaware of the effect it had all of us down here.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        So the sun would die and take heaven with it, shocking it into a tremor of purple and red. It made a sound if you listened closely and realized that there was no <em>sound</em> sound. That it was coming from within you, a rattle of awe. Listening, understanding that this was the apex of life, here at the apex of the world. Then evening would drag the colors of the day down and replace it with the question of night, the one that begs you out of bed to see the new earth and the things in it. I remember the way the night was when I was standing in parking lots, waiting with a friend to get out of the Ingles supermarket, embracing an armload of precious beer, back when it was precious, before we would go swerve from one house party to another.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        There are two skies in Asheville.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        It was then when I first saw that strange sight peculiar to Asheville: of the lights of the homes dug into the hills falling in around our valley they reflected the cathedral of the dark blue sky, and made a pantomime of the stars for us, but one that still held some charm for me, to know there were people walking and sleeping up in the lights and looking down on us, maybe wondering what we were doing, or maybe looking up at the star and the pit of ink that enveloped us in its endless hands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza prose">
                        But in Asheville, only the beginnings of things are good. Before long, you’ll find something to complain about. No matter what it is you will forget those days when you first arrived, and made your body face the raised earth around us, tall with unassuming might, and profound with otherworldly color. So I want to write to you about that and I want you to understand how beautiful Asheville could be, before it changed or before I grew, before a thoroughfare of depression in my early 20s turned to ice those times when I was happy and real.

                    <h4>Doubt and Science</h4>
                    <p class="stanza">Plato says that philosophy begins<br>
                        when one begins to doubt.<br>
                        Philosophy is the birth of science<br>
                        because it is the birth of doubt.<br>
                        To me, doubt is the most<br>
                        important component<br>
                        of scientific method,<br>
                        period.<br>
                        Doubt is the difference between<br>
                        scientists and technicians.<br>
                        What is science and research if not<br>
                        a cry for understanding?<br>
                        Real understanding.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">To understand, you must fully doubt<br>
                        never take anything for granted.<br>
                        Finally, doubt is the first reaction<br>
                        to anything important<br>
                        from the person<br>
                        who thinks for himself.<br>
                        If no scientist had ever<br>
                        thought for himself,<br>
                        then there would<br>
                        be no science.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">Science, reason and intellect<br>
                        may be the major organs,<br>
                        but doubt is the blood.<br>
                        Doubt is the subtle shadow<br>
                        that gives texture<br>
                        to the masterpiece.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">First, doubt everything.<br>
                        Slowly, over time, you will see<br>
                        how to doubt in a more productive way.<br>
                        You will internalize the trait<br>
                        of the discerning eye<br>
                        and guide your life with control.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">Most people today like science<br>
                        because it makes sense<br>
                        and there is an answer.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">You feel as if you<br>
                        could reach out<br>
                        and touch it.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">It is troublesome to me to try<br>
                        to explain to them why<br>
                        it is important to approach life<br>
                        in a more holistic way.<br>
                        Possibly, it is because<br>
                        I myself am always doubting.<br>
                        Maybe I have it wrong.<br>
                        Maybe it doesn’t matter.<br>
                        Maybe they’re right after all.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">Also, it is hard to quantify<br>
                        and present results in a<br>
                        thoroughly non-subjective format.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">Unfortunately, when you succumb to this,<br>
                        you are speaking a language<br>
                        that scientists don’t understand<br>
                        and never will.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">I think many scientists
                        have a sneaking thought
                        that there is something
                        to the study of deeper things,
                        but they either might not
                        admit it themselves
                        or simply view it
                        as abrogation.</p>

                        that spark you saw wasn’t really<br>

<p class="stanza">There were times when I’d hear<br>
the pummel of the kick drum<br>
and yearn for Europe again.</p>
<p class="stanza">The Europe I knew, killed at night,<br>
lying on the operating table,<br>
where we would run through it.</p>
<p class="stanza">On the canvas of cobblestones<br>
electrified by the rain,<br>
bright as a path of stars<br>
to the neon gilded clubs<br>
where people would breathe a night<br>
of sweat and cigarette smoke<br>
and bodies would buffet you<br>
from tomorrow, where you were<br>
wide-eyed but seeing nothing,<br>
a slave to the drop.</p>
<p class="stanza">You couldn’t get lost anywhere<br>
like you could at a club,<br>
indeed Europe is forgetting lost.</p>
<p class="stanza">I have the feeling when I am there<br>
that I am standing on something<br>
very old and very firm<br>
like an ancient stone.</p>
<p class="stanza">It is the future but it also<br>
is primordial, that place,<br>
for an American at least.</p>
<p class="stanza">Europe is my world forever now<br>
because it was once<br>
for a handful of nights.</p>

                        Doubt is that shadow which adds depth and texture to life the way it does the same to paintings. It propels us from a two dimensional world into one where we see more clearly. Doubt was how I began to live again. At first doubt was hate; it was like a death. Then I found life again. It was around the same time I found Lee.

                        She had one of those faces where soft shadows seemed to gather more than those of other girls. When she walked, they slipped along the hems of her finely boned face like the daytime twilight caught under trees, mocking the summer. So it was, by way of these wells of shadows, that for all her sunny hair and glossy eyes, her countenance gave the impression of looking into something very deep, a pool of water collecting beneath a waterfall far lost in a forest. One would forget to think and see some movement in that water, for a second abandoned by logic and reason and sink lower into her gaze. Here was a world a thrilling distance from our own, filled with fairies and gentle blue light pulsing in languid meter. Far away was music heard so distantly each instrument coalesced into one undulating melody, a melody that sent whispers down your spine like a taunting drip of rainwater; all these and other such thoughts that attended her presence could make stillness bloom on busiest and bitterest street comers in the loudest cities, on days the gray of cinderblocks.

                        These were the feelings pulling at me when I spoke to her, they of course in conflict with trying to appear normal and composed around her. Being close to Lee tended to make me do things I didn’t want to do and say things which later, alone and sleepless in bed at night, I retraced masochistically over and over again, punishing myself for having done and said them. I ran from her and to her, and if she knew how much I loved to swing between those two, I didn’t care. She had me from the moment I brushed against her atmosphere.

Nothing is lost in a smooth, clean sentence, its facets carved to lagom. It will shine like one of those tiny diamonds that you need delicate forceps to pick up, and be worth a world more. The light will catch in it, refracted and abiding, contained and dancing, in a little world of crystalline filaments, and it will drive the gnawing termite thoughts from your brain just long enough for you to realize for that bleeding iota of time that you are deeply grateful to be alive, watching this flickering gem, or here at all.

We were dogs whipped by invisible fences when we got too close to the edge. We had walked through the same labyrinth and wound up through circuitous routes right next to each other, only to be separated by a single wall, too thick to broach, too thin not not hear the others’ cries from the deep.

We all saw our own skies just the way we saw them, and what business people made of making sense of all of us was both for granted, secure, and horrifying.

I’d think how close they seemed. But how I could never reach them.

I was grateful and a profound and mature way that felt like a pleasant weight in my bosom, anchoring me to the day before and the day that would follow.

The one thing I do know about is that one is either oblivious to it, or terrified of intimating descants (lilt.).

                        I am grateful not only with every step I take and every glimpse of the sun that tangles itself in my eyes for flashing seconds, but every time I take off a shoe to address an itch, every time I have to get a chair to access the top parts of cabinets, every time I put on headphones while I fold my laundry, every time I have been bored in bed with nothing to do. In the music of the mundane, I found not only some release, but a wafting sense of identification with the world of humans, and that’s the world we all will face in the end, sooner or later. It just depends on when in your life it happens. The longer you push it back over the next horizon, the harder it will be to realize that simple eloquence of the routines of living are the truest paths of humans, well worn like indian avenues through the thickets of pre-colonial America. The tacit promise in them will act some minor unguent to the crouching, frustrating motes of pain that danced darkling in one like photo negatives of fireflies. They will dart into the wedges and nooks of the house like cockroaches if you seek them, but to combat them, you have boredom.

                        There is something intoxicating about American air. It is tickling madness, disguised by a vague veneer of “us” that darts behind corners right as you begin to chase it to find out more about what it is. “Us” is it, in america and I couldn’t believe it—that is, how simply it was to come across. This family of people it seemed to me, in the eternal summer of america, with no one pointing to how the cake was melting, and some people ran around in a shadowy, subterranean world, only emerging at infrequent times and unusual places. No one knew how the mosquitoes were blurring air slowly, or how the dog was dead, curled up under the deck. You leave for a month or two and america starts molting its feathers and you see how it really is, whatever that may be to you. But then you return and are almost suddenly caught up in the parade. Bright colors and the thrill of speaking your own language again and the people who share some sense of ideological genealogy with you; it’s almost too good to pass up. America is my family, my brother and my sister. I can hate it with familial, but when it draws me up in its arms, I cannot stay on the ground.

                        Being alone, alone and wanting not to be, is the most profound emptiness I know. From afar, they are everything your gauziest dreams could contain. In beauty formed, they smell nice, and when they laugh that free high laugh of a happy girl, you hear nothing else. They are smaller than you and seem to flow underneath all the things men say and think in a secret set of hidden canals where, though just underneath, you see them from a very long way off, in the own corner of the days we share in the world, one so much better than mine.

                        Your friends in relationships will say they understand that private hurt of being alone, but they don’t. Even if they do, they don’t feel it now and now is all that matters. Even if they did once feel it, you don’t want them to. Because as bad as it is, you don’t want to be relieved of it. Most of the people I know get with their pain by at least deriving from it. The conviction that they’re paying is their own private and unique pain. That they are their own wounded geniuses and gangsters with hearts of gold. Everyone is misunderstood. Everyone has endless parts of them that no one will ever know. Everyone is mysterious, the main character of their own maudlin drama. That’s not what they say explicitly but it’s their greatest faith.

                        While all this is happening, sooner or later that loneliness gnarls itself into a subterranean anger as hard as oak in your stomach. Sooner or later, you are too proud to want to change. Or worse, you’ve made unlikely friends with that pain and extracting it from you would be like curing a patient of cancer by guillotining them, or throwing them off a cliff. Entering into conspiracy with your own anger is unequivocally dangerous. That is the end of loneliness and the beginning of damnation.

And I think she saw too much when she explored the cellars of her mind with him, so her heart noticed the nascent love for him and closed the door to that promising hallway quickly, before she understood the true fathoms of evil corroding, at her cellular level, the shining eidolon she pretended truly was herself. The pretty idea, that thing inherited from all of our clean-handed childhoods, where this disease of age would not come for us from the hole between the worlds, and the light of our ideas, our shared boundaries to this universe.
