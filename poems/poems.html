                    <p class="stanza">
                        When she laughs and I hear her,<br>
                        walking in front of her or behind,<br>
                        no matter our distance, I am near her;<br>
                        she replaces every thought in my mind.<br>
                        The water of it, jumping, pouring,<br>
                        amid her lips, flowing, soaring<br>
                        from her neck, her head thrown back,<br>
                        igniting all the air she breathes,<br>
                        in thrilling fingerprints she leaves<br>
                        on me with what her laughter says.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        And what her laughter says is that,<br>
                        “I am nowhere else but with you now.”<br>
                        Then, this having been announced,<br>
                        the space around her levitates;<br>
                        it becomes a little weightless,<br>
                        elevating those who surround her,<br>
                        and endows on the air the traces<br>
                        of lightning which the water chases,<br>
                        the flash of flame that dances<br>
                        in splashes on the water’s faces<br>
                        down the dips and rippling places,<br>
                        makes electric that air with luster;<br>
                        her voice is joy and life recovered.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her voice is notes of sunlit motes<br>
                        like fireflies that closely float<br>
                        nearby, in late summer, and never rest<br>
                        the parts of them that softly glow.<br>
                        When she talks, it’s like her laughter<br>
                        is gathered up in bales together,<br>
                        in melodies, and gently tethered<br>
                        bound in bands of calfskin leather<br>
                        as brocaded locks of golden heather.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her words redound the gales of air<br>
                        then from her laughter’s music<br>
                        <span class="emdash"></span>all at once<span class="emdash"></span>lyrics are there.<br>
                        So, her laughter has its overture,<br>
                        a denouement, its quiet end,<br>
                        when her slowly fading singing,<br>
                        maintains still delicate ringing,<br>
                        even as inside silence tries,<br>
                        to eclipse her choir from sight,<br>
                        its memory made friable by daylight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her laughter is more gorgeous still<br>
                        than any words I could ever write.

                        withstand the siege of nature that buffets them<br>

                        My brother and his family would be.<br>
                        I’m not sure why I am always<br>
                        imagining my brother with a son.<br>
                        My cousins’ families move on along.<br>
                        My other living aunts and uncles.<br>
                        It’s possible I married;<br>
                        maybe she will come.

                        in a lonely tract of land somewhere<br>

                        finding a place with picturesque potential,<br>
                        a cliff where the wind will carry me away<br>
