                        When she laughs and I hear her,<br>
                        walking in front of her or behind,<br>
                        no matter our distance, I am near her;<br>
                        every thought replaced in my mind.<br>
                        The water of it, jumping, pouring,<br>
                        amid her lips, flowing, soaring<br>
                        from her neck, her head thrown back,<br>
                        igniting all the air she breathes,<br>
                        in thrilling fingerprints she leaves<br>
                        on me with what her laughter says.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        And what her laughter says is that,<br>
                        “I’m nowhere else but with you now.”<br>
                        Then, this having been announced,<br>
                        the space around her levitates;<br>
                        it becomes a little weightless,<br>
                        those who surround her, elevating,<br>
                        endowing on the air the traces<br>
                        of lightning that the water chases,<br>
                        the flash of flame that dances<br>
                        in splashes on the water’s faces<br>
                        down the dips and rippling places,<br>
                        lapping light-dappled encaptured traces<br>
                        in sparks that charge her air with luster;<br>
                        her voice is joy and life recovered.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her voice is notes of sunlit motes<br>
                        like fireflies that closely float<br>
                        nearby, in late summer, and never rest<br>
                        the parts of them that softly glow.<br>
                        When she talks, it’s like her laughter<br>
                        is gathered up in bales together,<br>
                        in melodies, and gently tethered,<br>
                        bound in bands of softened leather<br>
                        as brocaded locks of golden heather.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Her words redound the gales of air<br>
                        then from her laughter’s music,<br>
                        all at once<span class="emdash"></span>lyrics are there.<br>
                        So, her laughter has its overture,<br>
                        its denouement, and a quiet end,<br>
                        when her slowly fading singing,<br>
                        maintains yet still some faint ringing,<br>
                        even as outside a silence tries,<br>
                        to eclipse her choir inside from sight,<br>
                        its memory made friable by daylight.<br>
                        Her laughter is more gorgeous still<br>
                        than any words I could ever write.

                            <li>To add a bit of context: the most beautiful sound I have yet encountered is that of a woman laughing. The only thing that can make it better is if I’m the one responsible for it.<br>
                                <span class="tab-space w1"></span>A.’s laugh was music. Once, desperately trying to make her smile, I stumbled upon something she found so funny her eyes sealed up, adhered by pretty, sparkling tears. As she gasped in joy for air, her mouth opened so wide you could see the white molars all the way in the back of it.<br>
                                <span class="tab-space w1"></span>She was the best audience I ever had. From then on, until she moved away from Raleigh, I cherished every echo of that laugh I once listened to, sitting across from her during our lunch break.

                        by heartbreak, injury, into vapor.

                        in a lonely tract of land somewhere<br>

                        you can get an urn. But I’ll be<br>
                        incinerated by a riot of heat and fire,<br>
                        coming to rest in cinder and ash.<br>
                        If you want the charcoal that remains<br>
                        as arid scoria, use the cardboard box<br>

                        it was a paragon of brevity&hellip;

                    <h4>The Killing Forces</h4>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        I can hear whispers in the mortar<br>
                        binding bricks to one another<br>
                        in the walls I sealed together,<br>
                        laboring with careful trowel<br>
                        to split them from me forever.</p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        The clamor of the killing forces:<br>
                        intermingling their eerie voices,<br>
                        actuating smoke or pale vibration;<br>
                        they remind me I am forsaken.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Though broken by their aural throng,<br>
                        sometimes I miss them when they’re gone<br>
                        <span class="emdash"></span>for they have been, they alone,<br>
                        acquianted with me all along.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        The first career I ever wanted,<br>
                        what I affixed my target on:<br>
                        I’d be an angelic, divine agent,<br>
                        anointed, assured godly favor,<br>
                        bringing war to tenebrous anger,<br>
                        that would twist a blue aurora<br>
                        into a wan light crepuscular.<br>
                        I’d make it stop, and then wend<br>
                        it toward the day, back again.

                        I looked for God and did not find it,<br>
                        no holy nor unholy ghost,<br>
                        no spirits caulking apertures,<br>

                        I paced along each of the hallways<br>
                        winding all ways through my home,<br>
                        knocking softly on the walls.<br>
                        Rapt, I begged for quiet echos,<br>
                        signs this wall was but a mask<br>
                        and the face it hid was hollow,<br>
                        search the place once more tomorrow.

                        besides that practiced by mankind.

                        To focus while I made the raps,<br>
                        I closed my eyes and parsed the taps,<br>
                        devoted, beholden to my task,<br>
                        but did not sleep lest I should miss<br>
                        the sound of something calling back.<br>
                        In time, I learned I was alone.<br>
                        I prayed to the silence of the stone<br>
                        but always nothing answered ‘no.’

                        I heard no sound nor any talk,<br>
                        just drywall over cinderblock.
