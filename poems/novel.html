                        The rumor was of danger racing through the south. Serixiphina, the woman who lived in his head, was especially attuned to rumor; she had a great instinct for the general mood of any situation. For his part, he had excellent hearing. Or perhaps it was Sera, through him, extending and deepening his hearing to some pitch beyond what could be captured by others’ ears. He would ask her. She’d claim the interpretation most favoring her; she would, in exquisite nonchalance, assert that credit was hers for any ability he might have; but she always claimed that, especially when it wasn’t true.

                        It will render you grateful in that high, pure way that doesn’t pander to any articulated religion, trammelled and corrupted by the dust which millions of human hearts will create assuredly, or appeal to any low-down vanity of yours. A private gratitude, felt the way the view from a clean window is seen, bright, alive and unafraid, feeling without fear. For courage is facing a hard truth with clear eyes.
