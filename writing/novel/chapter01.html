                                            I will meet you there.

                                            the love you felt<br>
                                            had flown away.<br>

                                            then a joyous summer space<br>
                                            which, as I ruminate<br>
                                            had memories so fragile that<br>
                                            a touch and they’d disintegrate.<br>

                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="section-open">The rumor was of danger racing through the south.</span> Serixiphina was especially attuned to rumor; she had a great instinct for the general mood of any situation. For Eathel’s part, he had excellent hearing. Or perhaps it was Sera, through him, extending and deepening his hearing to some pitch beyond what could be captured by others’ ears. He would ask her. She’d claim the interpretation most favoring her; she would, in exquisite nonchalance, assert that credit was hers for any ability he might have; but she always claimed that, especially when it wasn’t true.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">So, with his hearing or with Sera’s, more than once, at the fort where he was taking inventory and performing an inspection of the garrison’s progress there, he heard some mixture of the following: armed men were coming from outside by way of the south. Word differed. Sometimes those around him said the band was coming from the west or farther east, but mostly the talk was on the southwest.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">An alien incursion was not an outlandish notion. But it required a great deal of speculation based on the information now available. He would wait until he heard something real. Perhaps it would remain only a rumor.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Still, Sera bade him watch that rumor. I cannot say for sure, she had said, but I think there is something to this.</p>
                            <div class="level">
                                <p class="stanza prose">Talk of the purported invasion started so quickly none of the men around him had even mentioned it to him in passing.</p>
                                <p class="stanza prose">Do the new men not trust you, I wonder? asked Sera. He saw her glinting, glowing grin.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p class="stanza prose">But Sera deigned to inform him what pitch the talk was at, as he was apparently losing the confidence of his troop. When she listened to the world around them in the way that only she could, she said, the susurrus of the raspy whispers had quickly became pervasive. When she made her findings known to Eathel, he’d already resolved to take it to an officer to get a verified report, using his own relatively acute senses.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Someone is coming, she said. He looked over at her. All he could see of her was the light of her smile, which looked like some trick of the sun, flickering just next to him, about as high up close to his face as a woman’s would be if a woman actually stood there now. It was her broad smile that always meant one more thing than he could figure. She smiled that way most often, her smile of two smiles.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">A small commotion had developed by the main palisade. Someone called him to come over. In the misty wind and cold and muck, he walked toward an exchange of information that would set off the second great adventure of his life.</p>
                            <div class="sb"></div>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="section-open"><em>A</em> herald had arrived.</span> Not even taking the time to dismount, he waited to be invited to speak, panting quietly with alert eyes. They had dark circles them, despite their agitation. Under stains from mud and weather he had on the livery of a prominent lord south of the mountains. Eathel recognized the worn orange lion vaguely but had forgotten whatever family it armigerated. He knew it was one of his father’s vassals, but he had not had much to do with that particular corner of the southeast, far past the mountain range. And his father had many lords under him.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">After asking whether he wanted water, Eathel bade him speak.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Lord marshall, on behalf of my liege, it pains me to inform you that our realm was three days past attacked.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Well, it wasn’t a rumor anymore. Told you, Sera said. I didn’t disagree that keeping an eye on that rumor would be good, said Eathel. No, Sera said. I just mean I told you and so I was right.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">He often wondered whether the best way to understand their curious bond was that they were siblings of similar age.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">They were certainly born around the same time; that is, within one or two years of each other. For though Sera remembered different things than he did, and she could move about within a close range while Eathel remained standing still, and in this way spy things he could not, she was a tenant in his mind; she seemed to exist nowhere else, and she did not know of events that far outside of their immediate domain. But her mind, as he instantly realized when they first met, was every fiber, endlessly her own</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"> before they were born but she should learn of them in the same way Eathel did. Which one was the elder, and whether that even mattered, was anyone's guess. Eathel had some strange feeling that, if one were to add some flesh and bones to this notion and run with the brother-sister relationship, they weren't twins.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Despite the fact Eathel simply couldn't imagine that he'd ever shared a womb with Sera, they were sometimes so connected, every now and then the two were so in accord they would say the same thing at the same moment.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Where are you from and who is your lord?” they asked. He heard her languid voice blend on his. His voice was the only one the world outside could hear. But sometimes she spoke to people as if they could hear her. She waited, all but tapping a ghostly foot, while herald told them his country.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">But Eathel didn’t think so. “Is Soronel still in control of his lands?” he asked.</p>
                            <div class="level">
                                <div class="">“He is,” said the herald. “So far, said posse’s conduct has been that of a band of marauders, not an army vying to spar with us on the field.”</div>
                                <div class="">
                                    Lucky guess, said Sera.<br>
                                    Correct guess, he said.<br>
                                    Mine was closer, she replied.<br>
                                    Mine was right, he said.
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Rules out a state, said Sera. Perhaps, he replied. Be quiet, he said. “Go on,” said Eathel to the herald.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>It was in the morning of that day, three days past, when we first heard a report by some travelers of a large band of warriors a-mount, making their way through our lands unchecked. According to a second report, this band apparently merely rode at first, but then they set fire to a village—the few travelers who had brought the news into the capital that morning disagreed on where, but they were agreed on the notion these men came from the southern border.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>How many are these men?” asked Eathel</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Three score. Of those armed, at least.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>What else have they done?”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>They burned a place where locals congregate near a town. The people gather there for trading crops; it is a little market, and many were there that day; they killed at least ten there first, then set upon another town ten miles north of there. And that crop exchange lost three siloes of many thousand pounds of grain.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Eathel waited. He outranked the herald, and so the emissary must show him deference and interview at the pace set by his Duke’s agent and marshall of his lands. But it was clear he felt he’d answered enough and now needed a response. Eathel still waited and looked at ragged soldier. Apparently, the herald would need to answer more.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>At the town,” the herald continued, “they killed anyone they saw. So far we know they lost three tens dead, struck down with no cause. Of material damage, several houses and part of a wall; and they robbed a church, seizing gold in coin and silver pieces of liturgy. This was all I knew when I was sent here.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Who were they?”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>I do not know,” said the herald. “As it concerns the witnesses who relayed the news, they did not notice anything particular about them, and they had no emblem discernible. They bore no distinguishing marks, nor did they appear foreign.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Where are they now?”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>When I left, they made for a manor nearby. The owner there is my lord’s neighbor; their properties share a border. So my master was compelled to fortify his own estate,” the herald said. “When I departed the brigands were moving east at speed. It is my current understanding they are moving north also.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Ask him where they came from, said Sera. “Where did they come from?” he asked.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>They emerged from our southern side. I know nothing else,” the herald replied.</p>
                            <div class="level">
                                <div>
                                    <p class="p-level">A force needed to be sent south, right into to the area under threat. He needed to know more, and provide what protection they could.</p>
                                    <p class="p-level">But it was at least three days of distance between them and the general area of where Cehedos began; and this was the case only if you pushed the horses.</p>
                                    <p class="p-level">Cehedos was big, but he wasn’t even familiar enough to know how far away the epicenter of the attack took place. It could easily be another two days’ ride.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <p class="p-level">Yes, Sera said, but with the distances in play here, you’re going to need to plan on going where they will be rather than where they are now.</p>
                                    <p class="p-level">Based on the herald’s report the marauders are also wending east. I think those cities are pretty squarely east of each other, one after the other in a string.</p>
                                    <p class="p-level">Ask him to confirm they’re moving east.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>It sounds like the host is moving east based on their course when you left, yes?” Eathel asked.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Yes, lord,” said the herald.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Eathel remembered someone telling him during his last campaign abroad, amid a stream of battles and camps and the smell of dead bodies, that, when it came down to it, the only form of tactical preparation that made any sense was to prepare, not with stratagems, but to prepare to be caught off your guard.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">Sera rolled her eyes, eyes which could neither see nor be seen. The thought seemed poetic to Eathel as he entertained it. Ah yes, she sighed. The only thing to plan for is that you will be taken by surprise. What a priceless jewel of counsel.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">The herald looked up at Eathel. Now it was up to the person charged with protecting the realm, stewarding it in trust while the real leader, his father the Duke, was occupied, to act.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose">But above all, it was the lesson he’d learned during the first few months of real campaigning that guided him now. Make the first move. Take an action. Make a decision.</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>All this is very troubling,” Eathel said. “Our sympathy is with those who are suffering, and our hope is your safety. We will do what we can to deliver it.”</p>
                            <p class="stanza prose"><span class="dquo-open-pull">“</span>Tastya?” Eathel called out. Tastya stepped forward. “You will take half the riders and some spare horses; transfer provisions enough onto the spares for a rapid ride to Cehedos and back. Take him,” Eathel pointed to the herald, “make the journey as quickly as you can; provide help you can, but unless you encounter the outlaws themselves, do not stop until you reach the place of the attack.”</p>
