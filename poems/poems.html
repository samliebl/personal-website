                    <p class="stanza">
                        We don&rsquo;t need nights in Montreal<br>
                        amid the parties and quick sounds<br>
                        nor twilights underneath moonlit tryst boughs<br>
                        that made a ceiling for us.<br>
                        there are other ways to make you know<br>
                        how deep it is that my love goes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        So can we step out now?<br>
                        And though it&rsquo;s dark and wet;<br>
                        the world is like a rainy window<br>
                        made slick and phosphorescent.<br>
                        I lived once on a bridge of cabs<br>
                        from here to Denver.<br>
                        Across town to your apartment<br>
                        so like all the others, only<br>
                        I am not in them tonight.<br>
                        And none of those<br>
                        will ever know<br>
                        how deep it is<br>
                        that my love goes.

                        I have all the stale air in the world,<br>
                        arms that last for days, closing on nothing;<br>
                        dusty eyes wasted from lack of sleeping forms<br>
                        to fill their vision.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        Untouched by the magic of the stars,<br>
                        milky in the dreams of lovers<br>
                        in the calm night torrents<br>
                        of dear propinquity<br>
                        and shared dreams.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        Staring at the cage the eyelids make,<br>
                        feeling a breath, unawake,<br>
                        reeling to the music<br>
                        of the waterlight&rsquo;s sleeping gaze,<br>
                        finding nothing.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        Muffled by auburn locks and sighs<br>
                        and in all this: the warmth of thighs,<br>
                        the cold cluster of the banished air outside<br>
                        knocking in its silent, ancient cry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        The fleeting goings of all the soft tones<br>
                        who made harmony only seconds ago.<br>
                        The evanescence of the balmy night winds.

                        This was my prayer<br>
                        to the twilight clouds,<br>
                        luminous with unearthly light<br>
                        and the unheard running water<br>
                        that flows through the fields<br>
                        when the sun has gone<br>
                        and left its shadow behind.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        And so the night gave me you<br>
                        and the space between us, closing fast,<br>
                        as I draw to you<br>
                        and move across<br>
                        from the white<br>
                        to the creamy glow<br>
                        of your drowsy light<br>
                        to match the swaying shadows&rsquo; pace<br>
                        as they make<br>
                        a home of the space<br>
                        around your eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stanza">
                        The night chills will still find us<br>
                        and the edges of skin uncovered,<br>
                        open to the wilderness of a strange room<br>
                        and free to the wild bright<br>
                        of a crazed moon.

                        So we must be together now.<br>
                        I seal this sooth from greedy eyes<br>
                        and trying grasps to take<br>
                        the world makes<br>
                        at our private nights.

                    <p class="stanza">
                        I want you now; I&rsquo;ll want you when<br>
                        the world falls apart and begins again<br>
                        because we were together then<br>
                        as the night made plays<br>
                        to take its wonder from our hearts.

                        I think it&rsquo;s all how you face the darkness<br>
                        in all your strange and desparate ways.<br>
                        My method, for now at least,<br>
                        is to hide from dark in your embrace.
