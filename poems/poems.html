                        amid the parties and quick sounds<br>
                        nor twilights underneath moonlit tryst boughs<br>
                        that made a ceiling for us.<br>
                        there are other ways to make you know<br>
                        how deep it is that my love goes.

                        So can we step out now?<br>
                        And though it&rsquo;s dark and wet;<br>
                        the world is like a rainy window<br>
                        made slick and phosphorescent.<br>
                        I lived once on a bridge of cabs<br>
                        from here to Denver.<br>
                        Across town to your apartment<br>
                        so like all the others, only<br>
                        I am not in them tonight.<br>
                        And none of those<br>
                        will ever know<br>
                        how deep it is<br>
                        that my love goes.

                        They swept above the plow<br>
                        as I pushed it;<br>
                        and I must have known you even then,<br>
                        as unknowable your beauty is,<br>
                        I must have heard some echo<br>
                        and felt you in my breast<br>
                        which until then was a hollow place<br>
                        because I had not met you yet.

                        And the way those clouds looked<br>
                        against the azure sea sunken in the sky!<br>
                        I took that blue and made your eyes.<br>
                        I blanched the ivory for your bones<br>
                        and once pristine, I smoothed them so<br>
                        I could make you stand, and sit, and roam;<br>
                        yet be as silent as a mountain reach;<br>
                        and as silky as fresh ocean foam.

                        I wove the bowstrings of your throat<br>
                        so they&rsquo;d sing the sighs of trees<br>
                        and hit the lonely, plaintive notes<br>
                        for with you I want to weep<br>
                        and be contained by you.<br>
                        So I made you.

                        Three times I burned the whitest fires<br>
                        for you on my altar and awoke<br>
                        to the morning dew.<br>
                        I saw six signs from the Cyprian,<br>
                        she who could breathe life into you.<br>
                        And I ran home to see.

                        flug the door to break the hinge,<br>
                        collapsing at your pedestal,<br>
                        scared to look above lest<br>
                        my mind betrayed me.<br>
                        In the maw of night<br>
                        I slept not and missed you<br>
                        in my dreamy wanderings.<br>
                        My apprehension and anger<br>
                        at what is left over in the world<br>
                        when you&rsquo;re not in it:<br>
                        a dusty speck.<br>
                        Iron and blood,<br>
                        and no song.<br>
                        No song.

                        Your face is smooth and soft geometry<br>
                        fashioned in lapidary harmony.<br>
                        It's a realm of perfect shapes, all those<br>
                        connected by one kind of foundation;<br>
                        its lineaments more powerful, clear and windswept,<br>
                        and its planes, the principle guiding its fairness

                        In glassine arches I found a calm conversation<br>
                        and in your eyes, a promise of wealth,<br>
                        adjacend spaces undulating, they<br>
                        ripple like molten gold and then avast<br>
                        by some remarkable craft of whatever god<br>
                        formed you in a spark of genuis.

                        The gentle ways you move your hands

                        Movements and sound waves<br>
                        finding accord in the way you walk a street,<br>
                        or brush your hair,<br>
                        when you're silent and won't talk to me.

                        purchase inside yourself<br>
                        and forget for a moment<br>
                        that the world is there.

                        and recoinoiter my own face,<br>
                        satisfied even when they wouldn't,<br>
                        that I could steal a few more moments<br>
                        studying with intent your grace.

                        where no city lights glowingly disguise<br>
                        our course of sight for them,<br>
                        along all the long and happy days<br>
                        I hope are observed by your gaze.
