                    <section class="chapter" id="Fight_In_The_Woods">
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">The world around Eathel was a flurry of action. Retainers scurried to stanch the bleeding coming from their young lord’s leg.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Serixiphina returned to him, as she sometimes did, in a dream.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Thought thee lost back there, man, said Sera.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">She leaned into the ‘man’ part of the jape. One of her recurring characters was a man equal parts hapless and bumbling. This pastiche served as her general way of impersonating military men, and really men in general.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Whatever the joke was, it was on men.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">It was strange. In this vision, he could see more form to her. She was a compound of shadowy curves. But one curve was bright, and right where a woman's mouth would be if one stood beside him. A glowing crescent of moonlight, that grew brighter, but then waxed and then waned with the rise and fall of her voice.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">No one else ever saw these things but he; no one else ever seemed to hear her voice; and he had learned better than to tell of her to anyone else.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Her canini¹ were more prominent than her other teeth.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Though they were enveloped by darkness all around, the space in his vision occupied by Serixiphina was somehow a deeper dark; it looked like peering into some impossibly endless chasm, a void aphotic.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Where were you? He asked.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">She grinned. That smile the color of pale moonlight.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">You left me when I needed to talk to you. When I needed a word of comfort, where were you? he asked.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Wherever I wanted to be, said she.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Serixiphina said the words with such finality. Her delivery thereof left no space for any countermand.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">She was a pool of nocturne dye that glowed deep indigo.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">She was a cackling performer, and she distended to reach up and down, forever, in both ways.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">The colors of the stars and the night moved as though inspired with life themselves</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Then her smile was moonlight no longer. It was the now a flash of lightning. And her voice was a blast of thunderhead.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">This is what it had been like when she first showed herself into his heart so many nights ago.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">And this is what the ghost in his mind said:</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">There are three secrets I will tell you.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Each one when the time is right,</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">and you will know them all as true</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">all shadows they, undone by light.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">you will not die before such time</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">as have I relayed these facts in full.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">I have the way ahead in mine eyes,</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">but after that a darkness pulls</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Then Serixiphina told Eathel what would happen and how things would be.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">She told him the things that would be done to him, and the things that he would do to others.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">And Eathel saw that all of it was true and he wept.</p>
                        <p class="stanza prose.ni.ws">Even though he was in a dream, Eathel curled himself into the shape of a baby in its mother, and sobbed with renting anguish.</p>
