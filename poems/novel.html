                        You asked me can you join me<br>
                        on a walk at home, could I please?<br>
                        you had word you would share<br>
                        By the glade of cherry trees, I said<br>

                        in the glade of blooming cherry trees,<br>
                        the baby saplings in their nurseries<br>

                        were no longer those cast by the cherry trees<br>
                        it was a new dark that would not leave<br>

                <span class="crawl-open i">Revolt!</span> — The southeastern barons have yet again risen up against their lord, the <span class="uc">Duke of Tera</span>. To put down the insurrection, he personally marches an expeditionary force deep into the lands of the defiant vassals.
            </p>
            <p>
                To guard the homefront in his absence, the Duke has recalled his son <span class="uc">Eathel</span> from far away campaigns and appointed him marshal, empowered to lead the garrisons remaining in defense of the main part of the realm. His father far away, indefinitely absorbed in quelling the rebellion, the new marshal spreads his trusted band of veterans across the broad plains of central Tera.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="uc">Eathel</span> has barely made his preparations when word of heinous mayhem in a border region makes its way to him…
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lug"></div>
        <p class="p"><span class="chapter-open">The rumor was</span> of danger racing through the south. Serixiphina, the woman who lived in his head, was especially attuned to rumor; she had a great instinct for the general mood of any situation. For his part, he had excellent hearing. Or perhaps it was Sera, through him, extending and deepening his hearing to some pitch beyond what could be captured by others’ ears. He would ask her. She’d claim the interpretation most favoring her; she would, in exquisite nonchalance, assert that credit was hers for any ability he might have; but she always claimed that, especially when it wasn’t true.</p>
        <p class="p">So, with his hearing or with Sera’s, or theirs together, more than once, at the fort where he was taking inventory and performing an inspection of the garrison’s progress there, he heard some mixture of the following: armed men were coming from outside by way of the south. Word differed. Sometimes those around him said the band was coming from the west or farther east, but mostly the talk was on the southwest.</p>
        <p class="p">An alien incursion was not an outlandish notion. But it required a great deal of speculation based on the information now available. He would wait until he heard something real. Perhaps it would remain only a rumor.</p>
        <p class="p">Still, Sera told him to watch that rumor. I cannot say for sure, she had said, but I think there is something to this.</p>
        <p class="p">Talk of the purported invasion started so quickly none of the men around him had even mentioned it to him in passing. But it soon became pervasive enough that Eathel had already resolved to take it to an officer to get a verified report.</p>
        <p class="p">He had only just made that resolution, there, in the mud of the works of the fort he was at to inspect that garrison’s progress, and then Sera was there, as if she always had been there for hours.</p>
        <p class="p">Someone is coming, she said. He looked over at her. All he could see of her was the light of her smile, which looked like some trick of the sun, flickering just next to him, about as high up close to his face as a woman’s would be if a woman actually stood there now. It was her broad smile that always meant one more thing than he could figure. She smiled that way most often, her smile of two smiles.</p>
        <p class="p">A small commotion had developed by the main palisade. Someone called him to come over. In the misty wind and cold and muck, he walked toward an exchange of information that would set off the second great adventure of his life.</p>
        <p class="p">A herald had arrived. Not even taking the time to dismount, he waited to be invited to speak, panting quietly with alert eyes. They had dark circles them, despite their agitation. Under stains from mud and weather, he had on the livery of a prominent lord of the south. Eathel recognized it vaguely but had forgotten whomever it was; he knew it was one of his father’s vassals, but he had not had much to do with that particular corner of the southeast past the mountain range. And his father had many lords under him.</p>
        <p class="p">After asking whether he wanted water, Eathel bid him speak.</p>
        <p class="p">“Lord marshal, on behalf of my liege, it pains me to inform you that our realm was three days past attacked.”</p>
        <p class="p">“Is your master still in control of his lands?”</p>
        <p class="p">“He is,” said the herald. "So far, the conduct has been that of a band of marauders, not an army vying to spar with us on the field.”</p>
        <p class="p">“Go on,” said Eathel.</p>
        <p class="p">“It was in the morning of that day, three days past, when we first heard a report by some travelers of a large band of warriors amount, making their way through our lands unchecked. According to a second report, this band apparently merely rode at first, but then they set fire to a village—the few travelers who had brought the news into the capital that morning disagreed on where, but they were agreed on the notion these men came from the southern border.</p>
        <p class="p">“How many are these men?” asked Eathel</p>
        <p class="p">“Three score. Of those armed, at least.”</p>
        <p class="p">“What else have they done?”</p>
        <p class="p">“They burned a crop exchange outside of a town in our west and burned another town ten miles north of there. Three siloes of many thousand pounds of grain.</p>
        <p class="p">They killed anyone they saw. So far we know have lost several hundred pounds of grain and a score dead, struck down with no cause. This was all I knew when I was sent here.”</p>
        <p class="p">“Who were they?”</p>
        <p class="p">“I do not know,” said the herald. "As it concerns the witnesses who relayed the news, they did not notice anything particular about them, and they had no emblem discernible. They bore no distinguishing marks, nor did they appear foreign.”</p>
        <p class="p">“Where are they now?”</p>
        <p class="p">“They made for the manor at Arkon, the owner there is my lord’s neighbor,” the herald said. “When I departed Cambrandt they were moving east at speed. It is my current understanding they are moving north also.”</p>
        <p class="p">Ask him where they came from, said Sera.</p>
        <p class="p">“Where did they come from?”</p>
        <p class="p">“They emerged from our southern side. I know nothing else,” the herald replied.</p>
        <p class="p">Eathel was silent for a moment. The man just looked at him. The herald had shared what he had to report and had answered more questions than he expected. Now it was up to the person charged with protecting the realm, stewarding it in trust while his father was occupied, to act.</p>
        <p class="p">He remembered someone telling him during his last campaign abroad, amid a stream of battles and camps and the smell of dead bodies, someone telling him once that, when it came down to it, the only form of tactical preparation that made any sense was to prepare to be caught off your guard.</p>
        <p class="p">Sera rolled her eyes, eyes which could not see nor be seen, a thought that seemed poetic as he entertained it. Ah yes, she sighed. The only thing to plan for is that you will be taken by surprise.</p>
