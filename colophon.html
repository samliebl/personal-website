                    <p>Colophon&emsp;&bull;&emsp;<em>noun</em></p>
                    <p>The term <em>colophon</em> derives from the Late Latin <em>colophōn</em>, from the Greek <span class="inter">κολοφών</span> (meaning “summit” or “finishing touch”).<sup>1</sup></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>a publisher&rsquo;s or printer&rsquo;s distinctive emblem, used as an identifying device on its books and other works.</li>
                        <li>an inscription at the end of a book or manuscript, used especially in the 15th and 16th centuries, giving the title or subject of the work, its author, the name of the printer or publisher, and the date and place of publication.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>What this site is made with</h4>
                    <p>This website was constructed with HTML5, CSS and plain ol&rsquo; vanilla JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>The HTML is all written using <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> as a starting point, and their CSS template, which in turn is based on <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> and that body of work by <a href="https://nicolasgallagher.com">Nicolas Gallagher</a>, et al.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/mrmrs/colors-saturated">Colors</a> include those curated by <a href="https://mrmrs.cc">Adam Morse</a>.</p>
                    <p>Though it seems to have fallen out of favor as an enterprise-grade CSS framework, I was immeasurably influenced by Morse’s work on <a href="https://tachyons.io">Tachyons</a> in its approach to writing HTML and CSS markup, but especially so in its aesthetic. Along with Morse, <a href="https://www.johno.com">John Otander</a> and someone else whose name escapes me were the original primary contributors to Tachyons, but I may be wrong there. In any event there is a large group of contributors <a href="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/graphs/contributors">on GitHub</a>.</p>
                    <h5>Typography</h5>
                    <p>This site is almost entirely presented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman">Times New Roman</a>, created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Morison">Stanley Morison</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lardent">Victor Lardent</a>, originally for the foundry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_Imaging">Monotype</a>. Described by <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com">Matthew Butterick</a> as a “workhorse” typeface, it’s widely supported and a standard typeface used across the web.</p>
                    <p>Here and there I employ <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>, the greatest open-source sans-serif typeface ever created, and the top contender for greatest overall. Inter was created by <a href="https://rsms.me">Rasmus Andersson</a>.</p>
